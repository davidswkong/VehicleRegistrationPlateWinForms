# Vehicle Registration Plate WinForms
*Student Project*

Vehicle Registration Plate WinForms is a Windows Forms prototype app that is a car park tracking and billing system for a fictional company Active Systems PTY.
It demonstrates the use of a List<string> to collect and process the vehicle registration plate information. 
The program is a simulation which takes data from a camera and reads the registration plates of each vehicle that enters and leaves the car park. 
The prototype will read and write data to a file which will simulate the camera, the basic operations will be manually operated using a series of buttons.
